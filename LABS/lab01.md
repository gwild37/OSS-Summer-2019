###### Smart Questions:
My first recommendation for posting smart question is: first consider how recent the problem is, because any older issue likely has an answer somewhere. I rarely ask questions on forums myself, unless a recent update or new program is having issues I have never seen before, because most problems have likely already been answered. Searching google long enough has found a solution 99.9% of the time. At RPI, I have never needed to ask any computer science related problems on any forums; despite stuff breaking all the time, I always find a solution online. My second recommendation is: before making your own new post on a forum, try responding in the comments of a post with a similar problem. Often the reason why I can't solve something is because I have a very similar problem to someone else, who has already been helped. Then I might consider replying to someone in the comments with my own modified problem, or how one might adopt the solution in some way to solve my own.
